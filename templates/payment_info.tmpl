<br><br>
The steps to successfully submitting a bid are:<br><br>
1) Pay your application fee.  This happens at BrownPaper Tickets (in another window).
Once you've paid your fee, you'll be able to create a draft application, save it and
revise it until you're satisfied with it, and then submit it.  Once your application
fees and application have been submitted, you won't be able to revise or edit your
application (but you will be able to view it so you what information you applied with!)<br>
2) Fill out your application<br>
3) Click "save Draft".  You'll see your application listed in your personal pane with the
notation "click to edit".<br>
4) Re-read your application to make sure you're happy with it and all required
information is complete.<br>
5) Click "Submit Application".  Once you click "Submit Application" you will not
be able to edit or revise your application!<br>
6) Your successfully submitted application will be viewable as a link in your personal pane;
it'll be displayed with a link which says "click to view", but you will no longer be
able to edit it.<br>
<br>
If you encounter an error which seems to indicate that you haven't paid your application
fee, please wait 5 minutes and re-submit your application (go to your personal pane, click
"Click to Edit", and once your information is displayed, click the "Submit" button).  If the
problem persists, please contact the registrar.<br>
