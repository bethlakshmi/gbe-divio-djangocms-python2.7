    their craftsmanship. Not all costumes that are offered are accepted. \

    homepage.</p>\
    <p>If you are offering a costume for display, it is your responsibility \
    to make sure that the costume is on-site before 9:00am on Saturday
    morning. Dropping it off on Friday is fine. If you drop it off before \
    6:00pm on Friday, it is likely it will be on display during The \
    Bordello. Costumes will be available for pick-up after 9:00pm on \
    Sunday evening. It is your responsibility to pick up your costume \
    and make sure all pieces are retrieved when you do so. In rare cases \
    and with previous arrangements, a costume can be picked up earlier on \
